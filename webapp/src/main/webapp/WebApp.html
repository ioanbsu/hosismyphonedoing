    <b>Why am I always see this message when I start the application?</b>
        <ul>
            <li>
                People tend to think that this application
                is a virus because after enabling AntiTheft feature they can not delete the application. Well this is
                not true,
                the reason why this application can not be removed once the AntiTheft feature is enabled is because of
                Android OS
                policies. Once the AntiTheft feature enabled the [How Is My Phone Doing?] app marked as device
                administering app.
                According to Android OS policies it is impossible to remove device administering applications from
                Android OS.
                So to remove this app it should we first unchecked as device administering app. After that it can be
                easily removed.
            </li>
            <li> Main purpose of this application is to provide control of your phone/tablet from the web site ioanbsu.com
            The [How is My Phone Doing?] application should be started only once to register itself in Google Cloud Messaging
            system. And after that there is no sense of starting and stopping this application - it is already registered
                in cloud and can be controlled from the website ioanbsu.com . The only reason to open this application
                would be to see instructions that are displayed in this popup.</li>
